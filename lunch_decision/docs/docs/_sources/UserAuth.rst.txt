User Authentication
====================

Introduction
The Lunch Place Decision app uses a user authentication system to secure access to its features. This section of the documentation explains how to register as a new user, log in to the app, and reset your password if you forget it. We will also cover the different types of users (Restaurant Owner and Employee) and their permissions.

Registration
To register as a new user, follow these steps:

Open the Lunch Place Decision app.
Tap the "Register" button on the home screen.
Fill out the registration form with your email address, first and last name, and password.
Tap the "Register" button to submit the form.
Once you have registered, you can log in to the app using your email address and password.

Logging In
To log in to the app, follow these steps:

Open the Lunch Place Decision app.
Tap the "Log In" button on the home screen.
Enter your email address and password.
Tap the "Log In" button to submit the form.
If you forget your password, you can reset it by tapping the "Forgot Password?" button on the login screen.

User Types and Permissions
The Lunch Place Decision app has two types of users:

Restaurant Owner: A user who owns a restaurant and can create menus and manage their restaurant's information.
Employee: A user who can vote for menus and view menus for the current day.
Restaurant Owners have permissions to create menus and edit their restaurant's information. Employees, on the other hand, can only vote for menus and view menus for the current day.
